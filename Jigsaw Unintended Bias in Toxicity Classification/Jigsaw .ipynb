One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being \"intolerant\" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of \"irratonal antipathy\" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).

Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.
